<h3>Note about v1.1 (v101):  We have re-predicted the gene models using BRAKER. The genome assembly is identical.</h3>

  <p>(Extracted from genome publication [1]). R. varieornatus is an extremotolerant tardigrade species, which becomes almost completely dehydrated on desiccation and withstands various physical extremes. It tolerates direct exposure to low-humidity 
conditions and withstands various extremes in the dehydrated state. R. varieornatus exhibits extraordinary tolerance against high-dose radiation.</p>

<p>"We conducted a precise genome analysis using one of the most 
stress-tolerant tardigrade species, R. varieornatus, which tolerates direct exposure to low-humidity conditions and withstands various extremes in the dehydrated state. We determined a high-quality genome sequence largely 
free from contamination that allows us to precisely analyse the gene repertoire, such as the proportion of HGT, and characteristic gene expansion or deletion. We also analysed the gene expression profiles during dehydration and 
rehydration. Furthermore, we focused on the abundantly expressed tardigrade-unique genes and present evidence for the relevance of tardigrade-unique proteins to tolerability, based on our investigation of the effect of a novel 
tardigrade-unique DNA-associating protein on DNA protection and radiotolerance in human cultured cells."

  <p>(Extracted from publication [1])</p>

<p>The genome sequence of R. varieornatus was determined by using a combination of the Sanger and Illumina technologies. To minimize microbial contamination we cleansed egg surfaces with diluted hypochlorite and before sampling 
the tardigrades were starved and treated with antibiotics for 2 days. After the removal of short scaffolds (&lt;1 kb) and mitochondrial sequences, we obtained the assembly spanning 56.0 Mbp (301 scaffolds). Coverage analysis 
(160 × Illumina sequencing) revealed that 199 scaffolds (99.7% in span) had considerable coverage (&gt;40), whereas 102 scaffolds had exceptionally low coverage (&lt;1; Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). We 
considered these 102 scaffolds (153 kb in span) as derived from contaminating organisms and excluded them from our assembly. As a result, our final assembly spans 55.8 Mbp (199 scaffolds; N50=4.74 Mbp; N90=1.3 Mbp; Supplementary 
Table 2). The span is highly concordant with the genome size estimated by DNA staining in the tardigrade cells (∼55 Mbp; Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting sufficiency of our assembly span and no significant inflation by 
contaminated organisms. We also constructed a full-length complementary DNA library from dehydrated tardigrades and determined paired-end sequences. BLAST search of these Expression Sequence Tag (EST) data against our genome 
assembly revealed 70,674 of 70,819 sequences (99.8%) were successfully mapped (E-value&lt;1e-65). The completeness of our assembly was also supported by high coverage (95.6%) in essential eukaryotic genes assessed by Core 
Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach16 (Supplementary Table 2) and the very low duplication rate in Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (1.13) indicated that our assembly was largely free from inflation by contaminating 
organisms.</p>

  <p>We generated gene models using the BRAKER pipeline with comprehensive RNA-seq datasets from different developmental stages. The previous gene set (v1) had a high proportion of single-exon genes, something which typically indicates erroneous gene prediction. The new prediction contains fewer genes (13,920 versus 21,493).
