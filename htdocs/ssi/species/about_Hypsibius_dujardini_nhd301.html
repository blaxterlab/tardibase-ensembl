  <p><em>Hypsibius dujardini</em> is a member of the phylum Tardigrada, a group of microscopic animals sometimes known as "water bears". This species, named after the French biologist Félix Dujardin, is found in moss and in freshwater habitats and has a cosmopolitan (world-wide) distribution. It is at least largely parthenogenetic (i.e., progeny develop from unfertilized eggs), with females laying eggs that undergo meiosis and then restore a diploid chromosome number by reduplicating chromosomes (rather than by fertilization). However, males have also been described, suggesting that some populations of this species may reproduce sexually. Like other tardigrades, <em>H. dujardini</em> can shut down their metabolism almost entirely and survive long periods in an extremely desiccated state. In this state, tardigrades are highly resistent to extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation. Desiccated tardigrades sent into space survived exposure to space vacuum and cosmic radiation with no significant effect on survival; exposure to unfiltered solar radiation had a strong negative effect on survival, but some individuals survived even the combined efects of space vacuum and cosmic and solar radiation.

 <p>The latest version, version 3.0,of the <em>Hypsibius dujardini</em> genome is currently being analysed before being formally released and published. It was assembled by members from both Arakawa lab and the Blaxter Lab using PacBio data [1] and Illumina sequence data.</p>  
<p>The previous version, 2.3, was originally assembled by Georgios Koutsovoulos in the Blaxter Lab in 2016 [2].</p>
